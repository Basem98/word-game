      <h2>The Game</h2>
      <p>
        This is a word game that has a Czech and an English version. The same as all the word games out there,
        this app's main goal is to strengthen your vocabulary knowledge in those two languages,
        but the difference is that this app gives you a sense of progress and achievement through the points & the
        titling
        system.
        You also get a list of all the words you have solved since your registration, in case you wanted to revise and
        memorize the words.
        As a motivation, you get to know who are the top 5 players in the game and compete with them as well!
      </p>
      <p>The titling system goes as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Absolute Beginner: 0 - 250</li>
        <li>Beginner: 250 - 500</li>
        <li>Absolute Amateur: 500 - 1000</li>
        <li>Amateur: 1000 - 1500</li>
        <li>Semi-Professional: 1500 - 2250</li>
        <li>Professional: 2250 - 3250</li>
        <li>Absolute Professional: 3250 - 4500</li>
        <li>Semi-Legend: 4500 - 6000</li>
        <li>Legend: 6000 - 7500</li>
        <li>Absolute Legend: 7500 - 10000</li>
        <li>IMMORTAL LEGEND!: 10000 - ~</li>
      </ul>
      <p>P.S: You get 10 points for each word</p>
      <p>
        P.S: I called the game vintage-inspired, just because the design gave me some weird nostalgia vibes of times, 
        when websites only consisted of boxes, buttons and a weird combination of colours. 
        The colour scheme used for the design is actually inspired from the flag of the Czech Republic, which consists of white, blue and red.

      <h2>The Developer</h2>
      <p>
        I am Basem Mostafa, a JavaScript developer, who is more focused on Node.js backend development at the moment.
        This word game is the first personal project that I built from scratch without following tutorials or code
        examples.
        I have been studying programming, web development and computer science in general since the 21st of July.

      <h2>Credit</h2>
      <p>
        All the words and their definitions are added by me into the database, 
        but they are all written with the help of the dictionaries I use for my studies, 
        which are the 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/">Meriam-Webster</a> 
        English dictionary and the 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nechybujte.cz/slovnik-soucasne-cestiny">Slovník Současné Češtiny</a> 
        Czech dictionary.
